# Excel-Data-Analysis

This project revolves around the Excel-based analysis and visualization of a dataset. The dataset, which can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/real-world-fake-dataset-for-practice, contains 32,941 rows of data.

In the initial data preprocessing stage, validated the format of each attribute within Excel. Specifically,  transformed the format of the "Call Timestamp" attribute from text to date format. Additionally, encountered missing values in the "CSAT Score" column, which were replaced with "NA."

To ensure data integrity,  employed conditional formatting in Excel to identify and eliminate any duplicate entries from the dataset. Subsequently, utilized pivot tables for aggregating data values, enabling a clearer understanding of the dataset.

For the final step,  harnessed the power of Excel charts to visualize the data from the pivot tables. To enhance interactivity and user-friendliness, incorporated Slicer options to create an interactive dashboard.
